        The general actuator below is a customized position actuator (with some damping) where
        gainprm[0] != kp (see http://mujoco.org/book/modeling.html#position).
        The reason why gainprm[0] != kp is because the control input range has to be re-scaled to
        [0, 255]. The joint range is currently set at [0, 0.8], the control range is [0, 255] and
        kp = 100. Tau = Kp * scale * control_input - Kp * error, max(Kp * scale * control_input) = 0.8,
        hence scale = 0.8 * 100 / 255
